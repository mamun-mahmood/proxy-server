# Node.js Proxy Server for URL Metadata Parsing and CORS Fixing

This is a Node.js proxy server that parses metadata from a given URL and fixes CORS issues. It is built using Node.js, Express, html-metadata-parser, and Axios.
This cloud be useful for a web app that needs to parse metadata from a URL but is unable to do so due to CORS issues.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/mamun-mahmood/proxy-server.git`
2. cd into the directory: `cd proxy-server`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`

## Usage

1. Start the server: `npm start`
2. Send a GET request to `http://localhost:3000/?url=https://example.com` with the URL you want to parse as the `url` query parameter.
3. The server will return the metadata for the given URL in JSON format.
